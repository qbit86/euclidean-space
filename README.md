# EuclideanSpace

EuclideanSpace is a generic .NET library for primitive types such as vectors and points in Euclidean space.
It mostly follows the design of the types in the [System.Numerics](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.numerics) namespace, but utilizes the “generic math”[^GM] interfaces introduced in .NET 7.
